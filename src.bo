// Intrinsics roadmap;
// intrinsics are an enum of all the different intrinsics.
// There is a corresponding ZST for each intrinsic.
// 'Instances' of the intrinsic ZSTs can be called as if they 
// were functions.
// The 'signature' of each intrinsic can be specific when defining it.
// Each backend has to implement the behaviour of each intrinsics separately(this is intentional of course).
// Intrinsics have a flag if they have side effects or not; which is hard coded, or maybe put at the site of the
// intrinsic definition.

// Should intrinsics only be definable in one function?
