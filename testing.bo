/// NOTE: Globals should be the last thing that's converted into C code.
/// That's because the state of globals can change; hence we should
/// make sure to only put them into C code once all compile time code
/// that could potentially have side effects on the globals have been run.
/// 
/// Constants are fair game however, because they are already not supposed
/// to be modified and doing so is UB. Doing compile time checking against
/// this is probably going to be done by encoding immutability in the type
/// system, but bit casting to an immutable type to a mutable type is always
/// possible, but you'd only do that if you wanted to explore the innards
/// and edges of the compiler itself; not if you're writing a serious program.
///
/// Maybe warn if someone bit casts between types whose only difference is their
/// mutability?
